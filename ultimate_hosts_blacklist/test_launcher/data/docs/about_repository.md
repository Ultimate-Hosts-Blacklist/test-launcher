# About this repository

This is an input source of the Ultimate Hosts Blacklist project.
Its objective is to test and provide a cleaned version the upstream list.

## Understanding the structure

### `.pyfunceble` directory

The `.pyfunceble` directory is the directory that PyFunceble consider as its
configuration directory.
In other words, it is where PyFunceble stores everything that has nothing to
do with the test results.

### `output` directory

The `output` directory is the directory where the results of the execution of
PyFunceble is stored until a test is complete (all subjects tested).

### `info.json`

The `info.json` file is interpreted by our launcher. It describes the
input source to work with, where to fetch it and when we fetch it.

### `clean.list` file

The `clean.list` file contains all `ACTIVE` results of
PyFunceble.

### `domains.list` file

The `domains.list` file contains the decoded version of the upstream list.

### `ip.list` file

The `ip.list` file contains all `ACTIVE` IP tested by PyFunceble.

### `volatile.list` file

The `volatile.list` file contains the content of the `clean.list` file + the
list of subjects which were flagged by the SPECIAL rules of PyFunceble as
`ACTIVE`.

### `whitelisted.list` file

The `whitelisted.list` file contains the content of the `clean.list` file
without all our whitelisted subjects.
