# About Ultimate Hosts Blacklist

The [Ultimate Hosts Blacklist](https://github.com/ultimate-hosts-blacklist/ultimate.hosts.blacklist) project is undoubtedly one of the world's
largest curated Unified Hosts file for protecting your network, computer,
device, children, or family against over several hundred thousand malicious
actors.

The Ultimate Hosts Blacklist differentiates itself from other similar projects
because of the usage of PyFunceble in order to distribute as much `ACTIVE`
subject as possible while continuously retesting all `INACTIVE` subjects.
